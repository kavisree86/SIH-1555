## Problem Title
SIH 1555: Create a Virtual Herbal Garden that provides an interactive, educational, and immersive experience to users, showcasing the diverse range of medicinal plants used in AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).
## Problem Description
Background: The AYUSH sector relies heavily on medicinal plants and herbs, which form the backbone of traditional healing practices. However, physical gardens that are not accessible to everyone. A Virtual Herbal Garden will bridge this gap by offering a digital platform where users can explore, learn, and understand the significance of various medicinal plants from the comfort of their homes. Description: Participants are tasked with developing a Virtual Herbal Garden that is engaging, informative, and user-friendly. This virtual garden should include: Interactive 3D Models: Realistic 3D models of medicinal plants that users can rotate, zoom, and explore from different angles. Detailed Information: Comprehensive details about each plant, including its botanical name, common names, habitat, medicinal uses, and methods of cultivation. Multimedia Integration: High-quality images, videos, and audio descriptions to enhance the learning experience. Search and Filter Options: Advanced search functionality to easily locate specific plants and filter them based on various criteria like medicinal uses, region, and type. Virtual Tours: Guided virtual tours highlighting specific themes, such as plants for digestive health, immunity, skin care, etc. User Interaction: Features that allow users to bookmark favourite plants, take notes, and share information on social media. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a comprehensive Virtual Herbal Garden that serves as a valuable educational tool for students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of the AYUSH sector. This platform should make the knowledge of medicinal plants accessible to a wider audience, promoting awareness and understanding of traditional herbal practices. It should be visually appealing, informative, and interactive, providing users with an immersive experience that combines technology with traditional knowledge.

## Idea

The proposed idea is to build a Virtual Herbal Garden Web and Mobile Platform that allows users to explore medicinal plants digitally through an immersive 3D experience.
Users can view realistic 3D plant models, learn about their scientific and traditional uses, and take virtual guided tours based on health themes (like immunity, skin care, or digestion).

This platform will serve as a digital knowledge hub for students, researchers, and the general public, promoting awareness of traditional AYUSH practices in a modern, interactive way.


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The Virtual Herbal Garden will be an interactive 3D digital garden integrated with multimedia, data, and learning tools.
It will:

Enable users to virtually explore plants in a 3D environment.

Provide detailed botanical and medicinal information.

Offer audio-visual content for better learning.

Allow search and filter by plant name, region, and medicinal use.

Provide guided virtual tours grouped by health themes.

## Use Cases
Explore 3D Plants	Users can interact with realistic 3D models — rotate, zoom, and view different plant parts.
📖 Learn Medicinal Info	Each plant shows details like botanical name, uses, habitat, and cultivation method.
🎧 Audio & Video Learning	Users can listen to plant descriptions and watch videos for an immersive experience.
🔍 Search & Filter	Users can filter plants by region, use (e.g., immunity), or type (tree, herb, shrub).
🧭 Virtual Tours	Guided tours of themed gardens (e.g., “Plants for Digestion”).
💾 Bookmark & Notes	Users can save favourite plants and write personal notes.
📤 Social Sharing	Users can share interesting plant details directly on social media.
🧑‍🏫 Educational Mode	Teachers and students can use it as a learning tool with quizzes or info cards.


## Technology Stack
The proposed technology stack for developing the Virtual Herbal Garden includes modern web technologies that ensure an interactive, scalable, and user-friendly experience. The frontend will be built using React.js or Next.js, allowing for a responsive interface with smooth animations and seamless navigation. For the 3D visualization of medicinal plants, technologies such as Three.js, Babylon.js, or Unity WebGL will be used to enable realistic 3D rendering and user interaction like zooming and rotation. The backend will be developed using Node.js with Express, or alternatively Flask or Django, to manage APIs, user data, and dynamic content efficiently. A MongoDB or Firebase database will store plant information, user accounts, bookmarks, and notes, ensuring fast data retrieval. All multimedia content—including images, videos, and audio files—will be hosted on AWS S3 or Firebase Storage for secure and scalable access. For user authentication, tools such as Firebase Authentication or JWT tokens will be integrated to manage login and privacy. The application will be hosted on platforms like Vercel, Render, or AWS, ensuring global availability and performance optimization. Design and 3D modeling tools like Blender, Figma, and Canva will be used to create the visual assets and UI design, while WebXR or Unity can be added later to support AR/VR-based immersive virtual tours. This combination of technologies ensures that the Virtual Herbal Garden will be engaging, visually appealing, secure, and capable of handling large-scale data efficiently.
